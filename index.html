<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Department of Mathematics</a> at the 
  University of British Columbia. Previously, during 2022-2023 I was a CARMIN Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.ihes.fr/en/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques</a> as well
  as the <a href="https://www.ihp.fr/en" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Institut Henri Poincaré</a>, where I was a participant in the thematic quarter on
  <a href="https://www.ihp.fr/en/events/geometry-and-statistics-data-sciences-paris" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Geometry and Statistics in Data Sciences</a>.</p>
  
<p> In 2022, I completed my PhD at <a href="http://cmu.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I was 
  fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~slepcev/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dejan Slepčev</a>. 
  While at CMU, I was also affiliated with the <a href="http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/people.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>StatML Group</a>. 
  During the fall of 2021, I was a visiting graduate student at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing</a> 
  at UC Berkeley, where I was a participant in the thematic program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/gmos2021/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Geometric Methods in Optimization and Sampling</a>.</p>
<p>My research is primarily in applied analysis and the theory of statistics and machine learning. I am especially fond of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>optimal transport</a>.</p>
<p>My publications can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2LPBB5YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Google Scholar</a>. My CV is <a href="Academic_CV_April2023.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>.</p>
